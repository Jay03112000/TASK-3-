# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis – Global Terrorism Dataset

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Global Terrorism dataset**, helping identify trends, patterns, and hotspots of terrorist activities around the world. It provides critical insights for **security and defense analysis** through data visualization and statistical summaries.

---

## 🎯 Objective

> As a **Security/Defense Analyst**, the goal is to analyze and visualize global terrorism incidents to identify:
- Hot zones of terrorism
- Most affected countries and cities
- Types of attacks used
- Yearly trends in terrorism
- Terrorist groups involved
- Target types and casualties
